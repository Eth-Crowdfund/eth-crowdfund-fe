    <h2>Why use EthoBoost?</h2>
    <h3><i><b>Etho Boost</b> is changing crowdfunding</i></h3>
    <p>
      <b><i>Efficiency</i></b>: Complete transactions in 30 seconds or less! Most crowdfunding apps take 3-5 business days to complete. Taking advantage of the Etherium Blockchain and digital wallets makes this possible.
      <br><br>
      <b><i>Transparency</i></b>: Donors have the power to approve withdrawal requests ensuring that donations are used as advertised.
      <br><br>
      <b><i>The Approval Process</i></b>: Booster managers set a minimum value that a donor must contribute in order to have approval rights for that booster. 51% of approvers are required to remove funds from a booster.
      <br><br>
      <b><i>Borderless + Bankless</i></b>: Built on the Ethereum blockchain, Etho Boost grants donors and fundraisers the freedom to exchange funds without the constraints of a bank account.
      <br><br>
      <b><i>Lower Fees</i></b>: Transactions on Etho Boost cost less than 1 cent! while most crowdfunding fees are 5% and are incurred by middlemen and international transaction costs.
