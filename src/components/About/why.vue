    <h2>Why use EthoBoost?</h2>
    <p>The crowdfunding industry is generally inefficient and convoluted.
      EthoBoost is a transparent alternative that offers autonomy and accountability
      to donors and fundraisers.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Trust:</b> The untrustworthy nature of crowdfunding websites deters potential
      donors because there is no accountability. Fundraisers are not expected to publish
      honest, detailed information about where a donated dollar goes, and EthoBoost
      demands more transparency. EthoBoost gives donors the power to review and
      approve requests to withdraw funds before a manager can complete a withdrawal,
      ensuring that donations are used as advertised. Fund managers set a minimum value
      that a donor must contribute in order to have approval rights for that fund. A
      fund manager must create a request to withdraw donations, and the request must be
      approved by over 50% of ‘approvers’ for the campaign.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Borderless:</b> Today’s financial system makes it extremely difficult to
      send and receive money across borders, forcing crowdfunding platforms to restrict
      transactions by imposing fees on international donations. EthoBoost is built on
      the Ethereum blockchain, granting donors and fundraisers the freedom to exchange
      funds without the constraints of a bank account.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Transactions(Fees and time):</b> Crowdfunding platforms generally charge
      a transaction fee of around 5%. These transactions take at least 3-5 business
      days to complete. Transactions on EthoBoost, facilitated by the Ethereum blockchain,
      cost less than 1 cent and complete in 30 seconds or less.
