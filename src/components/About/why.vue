    <h2>Why use EthoBoost?</h2>
    <h3><i><b>Etho Boost</b> is changing crowdfunding</i></h3>
    <div class="why-info">
      <h4><i>Transparency</i></h4>
      Donors have the power to approve withdrawal requests ensuring that donations
      are used as advertised.
      <br><br>
      <h4><i>The Approval Process</i></h4> Booster managers set a minimum value that a
      donor must contribute in order to have approval rights for that booster.
      51% of approvers are required to remove funds from a booster.
      <br><br>
      <h4><i>Efficiency</i></h4>
        Complete transactions in 30 seconds or less! Most crowdfunding apps take 3-5
        business days to complete. Taking advantage of the Etherium Blockchain and
        digital wallets makes this possible.
      <br><br>
      <h4><i>Borderless + Bankless</i></h4> Built on the Ethereum blockchain, Etho Boost
        grants donors and fundraisers the freedom to exchange funds without the
        constraints of a bank account.
      <br><br>
      <h4><i>Lower Fees</i></h4> Transactions on Etho Boost cost less than 1 cent!
        On the other hand, most crowdfunding fees are 5% and are incurred by middlemen
        and international transaction costs.
