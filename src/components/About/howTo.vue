    <h2>How to use Etho-Boost</h2>
    <h3>Step 1: Get a Wallet</h3>
    <p>Etho-Boost is a crowdfunding platform built on the Ethereum Blockchain.
      This means you will need a digital wallet to fully experience this dApp.
      <a href="#https://metamask.io/">MetaMask</a> is our wallet of choice. It is
      beginner friendly and attatches right to your browser. <a href="#https://metamask.io/download.html">
      Download it here</a>
    </p>
    <h3>Step2: Fund Your Account</h3>
    <p>
      In order to create or contribute to a crowdfunding campaign you will need to have funds in
      your account. Our application is currently in beta and as a result our transactions
      take place on the <a href="#https://www.rinkeby.io/#stats">Rinkeby Netwok</a>,
      an Ethereum testnet. You can obtain ether(ETH) on the Rinkeby network from the
      <a href="#https://faucet.rinkeby.io/">Rinkeby Faucet</a>. This network behaves
      much like the Main Ethereum Network but ETH spent on this network is <b>NOT</b>
      worth real money. <br><i>note: We are hoping to deploy our app to the Main
      Ethereum Network sometime in the future.</i>
    </p>
    <h3>Step 3: Connect to our site</h3>
    <p>
      MetaMask will ask for your permission to use our site. (INCLUDE PIC)
      We will only have access to your public address and nothing else.
